Welcome to the Lega Lab! We are delighted to have you join our team. This README file will provide you with an overview of the lab and its research focus, as well as acknowledge the contributions of previous lab members.

## About Lega Lab

The Lega Lab is a neuroscience research lab dedicated to investigating the neural mechanisms underlying human memory. Led by Dr. Bradley Lega, our lab utilizes various methods, including neurophysiology recordings, behavioral testing, and computational modeling, to gain insights into how memory functions in the brain.

Our research primarily focuses on studying memory in clinical populations, such as patients with epilepsy and those undergoing deep brain stimulation. By working closely with patients and employing state-of-the-art techniques, we aim to advance our understanding of memory processes and contribute to the development of effective treatments for memory disorders.
