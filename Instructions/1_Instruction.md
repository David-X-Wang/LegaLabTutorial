# 1-Introduction

Welcome to the lab! This tutorial aims to provide you with an overview of the lab's activities and help you become a productive and contributing member. We will cover various topics, including setting up BioHPC, running analysis, patient testing, and provide attachments giving a general overview of the lab.

## Lab Overview

Our lab primarily focuses on programming, with a strong emphasis on Matlab. Prior experience with Matlab is a plus but not mandatory. Many lab members have successfully gone through the program without prior coding experience, so don't worry if you're new to it. You are expected to learn quickly, and the best way to do that is by diving into programming.

To help you get started, we have provided several template analysis and plotting scripts on BioHPC. These scripts will guide you through the basics. Remember, learning programming doesn't come from running code that works; it comes from fixing code that doesn't work. Initially, you might encounter challenges, and that's perfectly fine. You'll never improve if you don't struggle through debugging your own code.

Fortunately, Matlab is extremely user-friendly and offers abundant online and offline documentation. The `help` function is a powerful tool when you encounter unfamiliar functions (e.g., type in `help reshape` to see documentation on the `reshape` function). In most cases, you can even type your questions directly into a search engine like Google (e.g., "How to average values in MATLAB?", "How to loop through files in a folder using MATLAB?", or "How to plot a line in MATLAB?"). Spend a reasonable amount of time troubleshooting an error before seeking assistance, and any lab member will be happy to help.

For experienced Matlab users, the provided templates serve as a guide. As you become more familiar with the analysis, you can write your own scripts to process the code in a way that suits your needs.

## Feedback and Updates

If you come across any issues with this tutorial (e.g., unclear instructions, typos), please send an email to jui-jui.lin@gmail.com. This tutorial will be continuously updated to provide a comprehensive guide for new lab members, helping them develop the necessary skills for complex neural signal analyses. Remember, if you have a question, it's likely that someone in the future will have the same question too. By addressing as many questions as possible within this guide, we can create a valuable resource for everyone.

Thank you and enjoy your time in the lab!
